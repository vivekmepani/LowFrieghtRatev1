<p>
    Intermodal shipping is transportation of freight from origin to destination in a vehicle or container using several modes of transport such as rail and truck. This logistically linked system uses different transportation modes in the most efficient manner allowing you to ship domestically and across borders while monitoring your shipments across every mode of transportation it takes. Intermodal shipping services allow trucking and railroads to work together resulting in a more cost effective, streamlined, reliable and efficient way of moving freight from one destination to another.

    Rail plus truck services are becoming increasingly popular as companies look to lower freight costs and reduce their carbon footprint. When you commission LowFreightRate.ca’s intermodal services, we take care of each piece of this system right from pick up to drop off so you can stay focused on other areas of your business.

In addition to intermodal services, LowFreightRate.ca also offers a wide range of value added services so get in touch with us to see how we can support your business.
